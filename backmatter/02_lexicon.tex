\paragraph*{Byzantine failure} A malfunction of a component that leads to the distribution of wrong/conflicting information to other parts of the system is called Byzantine failure. The name is based on the Byzantines Generals Problem, in which three Byzantine generals need to agree on a battle plan while one or more of them might be a traitor trying to confuse the others.
