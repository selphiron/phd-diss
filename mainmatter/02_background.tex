\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{cha:background}
In this chapter, we go through fundamental topics that are needed to better understand the remainder of this work.

\section{Crowdsensing and Citizen Science}
\label{sec:crowdsensing_background}
Other edge-assisted data analysis work includes Mei et al.~\cite{mei2017ultraviolet}, who measure UV radiation based on smartphone cameras and crowdsensing,
Cao et al.~\cite{cao2015fast} who use motion sensors to detect strokes in patients falling to the ground, and
Pham et al.~\cite{pham2015a} implement a smart parking system by equipping parking spots with RFID chips to track their occupancy state.
There are also multiple publications on placing different components of an edge-to-cloud data processing pipeline in various use cases, e.g.,~\cite{lujic2021increasing,pfandzelter2021zero,hattab2019optimized}.
