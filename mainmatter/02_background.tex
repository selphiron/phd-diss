\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{cha:background}
The main contributions of this thesis revolve around the SimRa project (see section~\ref{subsec:simra}), which is a crowdsourcing/crowdsensing citizen science application, with the goal of improving cycling comfort and cycling safety.
In this chapter, we go through fundamental topics that are needed to better understand the nature of the SimRa project and thus, the contributions outlined in chapter~\ref{cha:contributions}.
For this, we first outline which factors mainly influence cycling comfort and give an overview of recent studies from that research area in section~\ref{sec:cycling_comfort_background}.
We then continue with cycling safety in section~\ref{sec:cycling_safety_background}, which is related to cycling comfort.
There, we also differentiate between bicycle safety and bicycle traffic safety.
In chapter~\ref{sec:crowdsourcing_crowdsensing_background}, we point out similarities and differences between crowdsourcing and crowdsensing, so that we can later, in section~\ref{subsec:simra}, better categorize the SimRa project between them.
Lastly, to complete this chapter, we take a brief look into the field of citizen science, namely what makes a project a citizen science project, which benefits and challenges it brings and how the related work makes use of it in chapter~\ref{sec:citizen_science_background}. 

\section{Cycling Comfort}
\label{sec:cycling_comfort_background}
Other edge-assisted data analysis work includes Mei et al.~\cite{mei2017ultraviolet}, who measure UV radiation based on smartphone cameras and crowdsensing,
Cao et al.~\cite{cao2015fast} who use motion sensors to detect strokes in patients falling to the ground, and
Pham et al.~\cite{pham2015a} implement a smart parking system by equipping parking spots with RFID chips to track their occupancy state.
There are also multiple publications on placing different components of an edge-to-cloud data processing pipeline in various use cases, e.g.,~\cite{lujic2021increasing,pfandzelter2021zero,hattab2019optimized}.

\section{Crowdsourcing and Crowdsensing}
\label{sec:crowdsourcing_crowdsensing_background}
(Mobile) crowdsourcing and (mobile) crowdsensing have emerged as successful approaches to solve tasks in a fast and cost-efficient way and gather big amounts of data in a short time respectively.
\subsection*{Crowdsourcing}
``Crowdsourcing'' is a combination of the words \textit{crowd} and \textit{outsourcing}.
\textit{Crowd} refers to an often larger group of individuals, to which a task is transferred to, whereas outsourcing refers to a practice where an entity does not fulfill a task in-house on it's own, but hires people from outside to solve a task for them.
Crowdsourcing comes in many shapes and forms and can be found in many different areas, from transportation, to financing, from social media to natural crisis relief, etc.



\subsection*{Crowdsensing}
As in ``Crowdsourcing'' the crowd in ``Crowdsensing'' refers to a group of people, who voluntarily take over a task.
However, in crowd\textit{sensing}, the task at hand is mainly to gather data for the client, or in other words to function as a sensor.
