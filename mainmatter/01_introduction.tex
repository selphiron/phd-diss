\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}
The global climate crisis is and will be one of mankind's main challenges in the coming decades.
More and more societies worldwide are aware of this problem and search for solutions to adapt to the new changes that comes with the climate change and try to decrease the impact of the global climate crisis.
For the latter, the main approach is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as $CO_{2}$ and $NO_{x}$.
This is why cities worldwide try to increase the modal share of bicycle traffic and by doing so, decrease the usage of individual motorized transport, which is one of the main greenhouse gas emitters in urban areas (CITATION NEEDED).
This, however, puts cyclists, city planners and politicians into a difficult spot.
Since cities were developed with the individual motorized transport as the main transportation mode in mind, the traffic infrastructure highly favors the usage of cars.
Because of that, cyclists often have a hard time commuting, since they have to cycle on roads that were made for cars, which often puts them into dangerous and stressful situations.
Although crash statistics do not convey an increased danger for cyclists (CITATION NEEDED), studies have shown, that the perceived safety of commuting with a bicycle is very low (CITATION NEEDED) and one of the main reasons why people prefer other transportation modes to cycling (CITATION NEEDED).
It is up to city planners to improve the traffic infrastructure for cyclists, but it is not easy to pinpoint the most problematic areas, that need to be prioritized for them to be fixed, which is needed because of the limited resources available to the city planning department.
Besides, city planners are bound by city planning codes and rules, which oftentimes also reflect the car-centric approach.
This passes the responsibility to the politicians, who need to change the city planning codes and rules and also increase the funds for bicycle infrastructure.
For this, however, they need more than anecdotal evidence, that the perceived safety in bicycle traffic is low, so that they can change the legislation and increase funding in favor of bicycle infrastructure.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}
To enable city planners and politicians to do evidence-based decision-making, they need a) to be aware of the problems in bicycle traffic and b) to know where and how to improve the bicycle infrastructure.
There are surveys that show that the perceived safety in bicycle traffic is low (MULTIPLE CITATIONS)
DO I NEED TO GIVE EXAMPLES HERE FOR SURVEYS?

\section{Structure of this Thesis}
\label{sec:structure}

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a cutting-edge service model that has developed with the current advancement of cloud computing.
Cloud functions allow custom code to be executed in response to an event.
In most cases, developers need only worry about their actual code, as event queuing, underlying infrastructure, dynamic scaling, and dispatching are all handled by the cloud provider~\cite{Baldini2017-zf,McGrath2017-or}.

This scalable and flexible event-based programming model is a great fit for IoT event and data processing.
Consider as an example a connected button and lightbulb.
When the button is pressed it sends an event to a function in the cloud which in turn sends a command to the lamp to turn on the light.
The three components are easily connected and only the actual function code would need to be provided.
Thanks to managed FaaS, this approach also scales from two devices to thousands of devices without any additional configuration.

Current FaaS platforms do provide these benefits for the IoT, however, using them in this way is inefficient.
Sending all events and data to the cloud for processing leads to a high load on the network and high response latency~\cite{paper_zhang_cloud_is_not_enough_GDP,paper_bermbach_fog_computing}.
It is much more efficient to process IoT data closer to their service consumers such as our lightbulb and button, as is the idea of fog computing~\cite{Bermbach2020-sf,Pfandzelter2019-so}.
Positioned in the same network, our button may send its event to an edge function placed, for example, on a common gateway.
This also introduces additional transparency about data movement within the network and alleviates some security concerns about cloud computing~\cite{Bonomi2012-if,paper_bermbach_fog_computing}.

Currently, however, there are no open FaaS platforms that are built specifically for IoT data processing at the edge.
State-of-the-art platforms are instead built for powerful cloud hardware, for web-based services, or are proprietary software that is not extensible.

We therefore make the following contributions in this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We discuss the unique challenges of IoT data processing and edge computing and derive requirements for an edge FaaS platform (Chapter~\ref{cha:background})
  \item We introduce \textit{tinyFaaS}, a novel FaaS platform architecture that addresses the requirements we have identified (Chapter~\ref{cha:systemdesign})
  \item We evaluate \textit{tinyFaaS} through a proof-of-concept prototype and a number of experiments in which we compare it to state-of-the-art FaaS platforms, namely Kubeless and Lean OpenWhisk (Chapter~\ref{cha:evaluation})
\end{enumerate}
